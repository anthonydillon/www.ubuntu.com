OpenStack is an essential component of every modern organisation which uses private cloud infrastructure for better economics, improved security and a higher level of flexibility. Red Hat and Canonical each offer their own production-grade OpenStack distribution, however, this has been achieved using a completely different approach towards OpenStack deployments, operations and support.

This whitepaper performs a detailed comparison of Red Hat OpenStack Platform and Canonical&rsquo;s Charmed OpenStack, including:

<ul class="p-list">
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">A comprehensive cost analysis comparing Red Hat&rsquo;s per socket-pair pricing model to Canonical&rsquo;s per host pricing model</li>
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Detailed comparisons of the support and managed services available for deployment, upgrade and day-to-day maintenance of OpenStack</li>
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">An overview of the integration capabilities of each distribution if used in a hybrid or multi-cloud environment</li>
</ul>
